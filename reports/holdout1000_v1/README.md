# Independent insurance holdout: construction in progress

This directory records dataset construction, **not a completed 1,000-question
benchmark or a model-quality improvement result**. No final benchmark answer
inference has run. Earlier exposed holdouts remain regression-only.

`protocol.json` fixes the 1,000-test minimum and a source-separated dev minimum
of 50 (150 preferred), task coverage, source balance,
review requirements and freeze conditions. `stage1_progress.json` and later
numbered progress files are timestamped checkpoints; do not sum their counts.
Source-original FAQs, authored hypothetical cases, advisory model decisions and
Codex content-review decisions are recorded separately. None is expert or human
adjudication. Provisional per-item clearance is not dataset acceptance.

The latest construction checkpoint is `stage18_progress.json`:
297 provisional TEST and 42 DEV records, with **zero frozen/accepted records**.
Stage18 retained six of sixteen cached-source drafts: four ordinary questions,
one calculation and one multi-evidence question. Six drafts remain held for an
unresolved historical document-family/alias relationship; four others remain
held for exposed or insufficiently independent information needs. Automated
screening produced no new flags, demonstrating why content review remains
necessary.

All 339 retained item gates pass. TEST covers 97 document families after
conservative closure of linked TRICARE Medicare, enrollment and repeated cost
table guides, preserving the existing deductible/POS/CHCBP relationship.
Another 703 independent TEST questions are needed for the size minimum;
task quotas, DEV size and the 100-family minimum also remain unmet. No final
benchmark inference, training or test-directed tuning has run.

Sixteen new question vectors were encoded in one local process and one forward
batch. All 44,581 history vectors and 2,594 previous candidate audit rows were
reused. Review covered 76 targeted historical texts, ten changed active-pool
neighbor records, source licenses, original table alignment and derivation
relationships. The broader focused search was used selectively: it is not
reported as entirely read. Source requests, paid services, additional agents
and raw-data publication remained zero. Targeted quality and containment
tests passed: 29 tests.

The previous published commit `728e40d` passed all five CI jobs in run
37374779493. This does not establish the status of a subsequent commit.
Earlier CI cancellation failures and the rerun integration 403 remain in the
historical records; no permission restriction was bypassed. Earlier construction
counts are superseded, not additive.

Review ledgers are deltas: absence from the latest ledger does not release an
earlier hold. Follow their hash-linked ancestry and preserve exclusions unless an
explicit repair and completed re-audit resolve them. The stage10 local record
binds all inherited decisions and the three unchanged repaired records; it adds
no new clearance and makes no change to the pool or source registries.

Source access/reuse decisions are in `source_status.json` and
`source_approvals.json`. An approval permits the stated local research scope,
not blanket redistribution or acceptance of every document. All source bodies,
question/answer/evidence text, model responses and full audit ledgers stay in the
ignored `local/` directory. Previously denied local paths and blocked sources
remain excluded.

## Reproducible stages

1. Preflight access and rights before acquisition. Preserve response hashes and
   stop on access denials; never change hosts or methods to bypass them.
2. `extract_holdout1000_candidates.py` writes a fresh immutable source snapshot.
   `build_holdout1000_evidence_catalog.py` binds paragraphs, short rule lists and
   complete tables (including VA custom tables) to exact source offsets.
3. `screen_holdout1000_history.py` checks normalized historical text and source
   URLs. `audit_holdout1000_near_duplicates.py` screens questions and evidence
   against accessible historical strings and all prior exposed source FAQs.
   Its character-cosine approximation is deliberately conservative.
   `audit_holdout1000_containment.py` additionally scans every contiguous
   normalized evidence window inside long historical records. Default evidence
   mode requires `--documents` and source-span metadata; `--text-mode` is
   explicitly unverified generic screening. Shared windows
   require review and absence of matches does not prove independence.
4. `audit_holdout1000_semantic_questions.py` uses a frozen local BGE model and
   verifies cached history/model hashes. It reports nearest historical and
   cross-document candidates, including neighbors below the flag threshold.
   Similarity scores are review aids, not proof of independence.
5. `triage_holdout1000_candidates.py` preserves document/split/duplicate groups,
   history exclusions and unresolved source defects, including the hashed
   `document_holds.json` registry and hash-bound `document_families.json`.
   Its output is a review
   queue, never accepted data. Context repairs and authored cases need their
   own evidence/history/semantic audit after revision.
6. Record individual content, source-currency, authorship and duplicate
   dispositions. A critical source error holds the affected stratum pending
   full review. Enforce corpus-wide refusal gaps and necessary, nonredundant
   evidence for multi-evidence tasks. Recompute numeric formulas with the
   restricted Decimal evaluator and check the applicability of their rules.
   Check scenario ages/dates against a rule's effective date and transitional
   provisions; correct arithmetic cannot repair an inapplicable rate.
   A question asking whether a public rule guarantees an outcome can be ordinary
   QA even when the actual private outcome is unknown. Refusal tasks must ask for
   that unresolved outcome. For multi-evidence tasks, remove each claimed
   necessary span in turn: if another span already settles the operative answer,
   hold the task classification.
   A numerical item must require an identified rule or rate to be retrieved;
   questions supplying all rules and inputs are held as arithmetic-only.
7. `holdout_quality.verify_dataset` must pass all item, split, coverage and
   review gates with explicit source registries before freezing
   corpus/manifests/ledger/configuration hashes
   and running the fixed final benchmark. No test-directed tuning.

`review_holdout1000_candidates_local.py` produces advisory source-FAQ screening
only. `draft_holdout1000_complex_cases.py` is experimental: two small local-model
pilots produced no accepted cases and bulk drafting was stopped after unsupported
claims, scope mistakes and arithmetic failures. Do not treat either script's
output as gold labels or model benchmark results.

The audit covers accessible project history, not foundation-model pretraining.
Source prose can be obsolete or internally inconsistent even on official sites.
Outstanding source conflicts, licensing uncertainty or review gaps are grounds
to hold a candidate, not to lower the protocol targets.

The stage4 review found substantive historical overlap below automatic
similarity thresholds, including evidence contained inside a much longer
historical record. A prior provisional item was revoked after checking that
passage. Whole-record cosine and question similarity must be supplemented by
passage containment and source-family review; zero flags do not prove novelty.
Invisible format characters inside source words also require repaired display
text and audits of both original and repaired evidence, while preserving raw
source offsets. The historical normalization/cache has not silently changed.

The original12-24hour construction estimate is superseded by the estimate in
`protocol.json`. The current review queue alone is smaller than the test target;
additional suitable sources and substantive information needs remain necessary.
