# Independent insurance holdout: construction in progress

This directory records dataset construction, **not a completed 1,000-question
benchmark or a model-quality improvement result**. No final benchmark answer
inference has run. Earlier exposed holdouts remain regression-only.

`protocol.json` fixes the 1,000-test/150-dev goals, task coverage, source balance,
review requirements and freeze conditions. `stage1_progress.json` and later
numbered progress files are timestamped checkpoints; do not sum their counts.
Source-original FAQs, authored hypothetical cases, advisory model decisions and
Codex content-review decisions are recorded separately. None is expert or human
adjudication. Provisional per-item clearance is not dataset acceptance.

Source access/reuse decisions are in `source_status.json` and
`source_approvals.json`. An approval permits the stated local research scope,
not blanket redistribution or acceptance of every document. All source bodies,
question/answer/evidence text, model responses and full audit ledgers stay in the
ignored `local/` directory. Previously denied local paths and blocked sources
remain excluded.

## Reproducible stages

1. Preflight access and rights before acquisition. Preserve response hashes and
   stop on access denials; never change hosts or methods to bypass them.
2. `extract_holdout1000_candidates.py` writes a fresh immutable source snapshot.
   `build_holdout1000_evidence_catalog.py` binds paragraphs, short rule lists and
   complete tables (including VA custom tables) to exact source offsets.
3. `screen_holdout1000_history.py` checks normalized historical text and source
   URLs. `audit_holdout1000_near_duplicates.py` screens questions and evidence
   against accessible historical strings and all prior exposed source FAQs.
   Its character-cosine approximation is deliberately conservative.
4. `audit_holdout1000_semantic_questions.py` uses a frozen local BGE model and
   verifies cached history/model hashes. It reports nearest historical and
   cross-document candidates, including neighbors below the flag threshold.
   Similarity scores are review aids, not proof of independence.
5. `triage_holdout1000_candidates.py` preserves document/split/duplicate groups,
   history exclusions and unresolved source defects. Its output is a review
   queue, never accepted data. Context repairs and authored cases need their
   own evidence/history/semantic audit after revision.
6. Record individual content, source-currency, authorship and duplicate
   dispositions. A critical source error holds the affected stratum pending
   full review. Enforce corpus-wide refusal gaps and necessary, nonredundant
   evidence for multi-evidence tasks. Recompute numeric formulas with the
   restricted Decimal evaluator and check the applicability of their rules.
7. `holdout_quality.verify_dataset` must pass all item, split, coverage and
   review gates before freezing corpus/manifests/ledger/configuration hashes
   and running the fixed final benchmark. No test-directed tuning.

`review_holdout1000_candidates_local.py` produces advisory source-FAQ screening
only. `draft_holdout1000_complex_cases.py` is experimental: two small local-model
pilots produced no accepted cases and bulk drafting was stopped after unsupported
claims, scope mistakes and arithmetic failures. Do not treat either script's
output as gold labels or model benchmark results.

The audit covers accessible project history, not foundation-model pretraining.
Source prose can be obsolete or internally inconsistent even on official sites.
Outstanding source conflicts, licensing uncertainty or review gaps are grounds
to hold a candidate, not to lower the protocol targets.

The stage4 review found substantive historical overlap below automatic
similarity thresholds, including evidence contained inside a much longer
historical record. A prior provisional item was revoked after checking that
passage. Whole-record cosine and question similarity must be supplemented by
passage containment and source-family review; zero flags do not prove novelty.
Invisible format characters inside source words also require repaired display
text and audits of both original and repaired evidence, while preserving raw
source offsets. The historical normalization/cache has not silently changed.

The original12-24hour construction estimate is superseded by the estimate in
`protocol.json`. The current review queue alone is smaller than the test target;
additional suitable sources and substantive information needs remain necessary.
